A modded version of our rocket patrol game.

Total: 105 pts
    Implement the speed increase that happens after 30 seconds in the original game (10)
    Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (10)
    Allow the player to control the Rocket after it's fired (10)
    Create a new scrolling tile sprite for the background (10)
    Create a new title screen (15)
    Implement a simultaneous two-player mode (50)

Note: It says create a new scrolling tile sprite for the background, but it didn't specify
      whether I could import an image for it. As compensation I created a new sprite for
      the player2 rocket.
